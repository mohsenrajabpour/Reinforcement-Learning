This library will give you a solid framework to understand how reinforcement learning experiments work and how to run your own. If it feels a little confusing at first, don't worry - we are going to walk you through it slowly and introduce you to more and more parts as you progress through the specialization.\n",

Pulling an arm generates a stochastic reward from a Gaussian distribution with unit-variance.

One way an agent could operate is to always choose the action with  the highest value based on the agent’s current estimates.

Why are we implementing our own instead of using the argmax function that numpy uses? Numpy's argmax function returns the first instance of the highest value. We do not want that to happen as it biases the agent to choose a specific action in the case of ties. Instead we want to break ties between the highest values randomly. So we are going to implement our own argmax function. You may want to look at [np.random.choice](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.choice.html) to randomly select from a list of values."

Depending on what action the agent randomly starts with, or when it randomly chooses to explore, it can change the results of the runs.

The agent could get lucky, and see larger rewards for the best action early on and so settle on the best action faster.

    "These plots help clarify the performance differences between the different step sizes. A step size of 0.01 makes such small updates that the agent’s value estimate of the best action does not get close to the actual value. Step sizes of 0.5 and 1.0 both get close to the true value quickly, but are very susceptible to stochasticity in the rewards. The updates overcorrect too much towards recent rewards, and so oscillate around the true value. This means that on many steps, the action that pulls the best arm may seem worse than it actually is.  A step size of 0.1 updates fairly quickly to the true value, and does not oscillate as widely around the true values as 0.5 and 1.0. This is one of the reasons that 0.1 performs quite well. Finally we see why 1/N(A) performed well. Early on while the step size is still reasonably high it moves quickly to the true expected value, but as it gets pulled more its step size is reduced which makes it less susceptible to the stochasticity of the rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this mean that 1/N(A) is always the best? When might it not be? One possible setting where it might not be as effective is in non-stationary problems. You learned about non-stationarity in the lessons. Non-stationarity means that the environment may change over time. This could manifest itself as continual change over time of the environment, or a sudden change in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at how a sudden change in the reward distributions affects a step size like 1/N(A). This time we will run the environment for 2000 steps, and after 1000 steps we will randomly change the expected value of all of the arms. We compare two agents, both using epsilon-greedy with epsilon = 0.1. One uses a constant step size of 0.1, the other a step size of 1/N(A) that reduces over time. "

    "Think about what the step size would be after 1000 steps. Let's say the best action gets chosen 500 times. That means the step size for that action is 1/500 or 0.002. At each step when we update the value of the action and the value is going to move only 0.002 * the error. That is a very tiny adjustment and it will take a long time for it to get to the true value.\n",

    "These are the types of tradeoffs we have to think about in reinforcement learning. A larger step size moves us more quickly toward the true value, but can make our estimated values oscillate around the expected value. A step size that reduces over time can converge to close to the expected value, without oscillating. On the other hand, such a decaying stepsize is not able to adapt to changes in the environment. Nonstationarity---and the related concept of partial observability---is a common feature of reinforcement learning problems and when learning online.  "
